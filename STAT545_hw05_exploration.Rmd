# Part 1: Factor management

Let's compare the use of `filter()` vs `droplevels()` upon removing "Oceania" from the gapminder data set.

```{r}
gap_filter <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

gap_drop <- gap_filter %>% 
  droplevels()

str(gapminder)
str(gap_filter)
str(gap_drop)

```

*Comments:* Use of `filter()` does not effect a change in the number of levels in country (142) or continent (5) factors, whereas `droplevels()` displays only the observed levels in country (140) and continent (4) factors. As expected, the dropped level in continent is "Oceania"; correspondingly, the dropped levels in country are "Australia" and "New Zealand".


Next, let's compare the use of `arrange()` and `fct_reorder()` to reorganize continent by GDP per capita.

```{r}
#With arrange()
gap_A <- gap_drop %>% 
  arrange(continent, gdpPercap)

#Reordered factors
gap_R <- gap_drop %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent, gdpPercap, .fun = max))

#Reordered factors and with arrange()
gap_RA <- gap_R %>% 
  arrange(continent, gdpPercap)


head(gap_drop)
head(gap_A)
head(gap_R)
head(gap_RA)

levels(gap_drop$continent)
levels(gap_A$continent)
levels(gap_R$continent)
levels(gap_RA$continent)

```

*Comments:* In the head of the tables displayed above, it is seen that the use of `arrange()` reorganizes GDP per capita in ascending order within each continent grouping. The use of `fct_reorder()` has no observable effect on the table itself. The use of both functions leads only to the observable effects of `arrange()`.

Usings `levels()` to check the factor levels, there is no difference after using `arrange()`. After `fct_reorder()`, the order of the factors changes. In this case, Europe has the second highest maximum, so `fct_reorder()` has changed its position accordingly from the default alphabetical ordering of contient factors.

Let's check the plots:

```{r}
gap_drop %>% ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
gap_A %>% ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
gap_R %>% ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
gap_RA %>% ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) + geom_boxplot() + scale_y_log10()
```

*Comments:* The use of `arrange()` only operates on the table output and has no effect on the plot. This makes sense intuitively, as the data points are still the same and thus the plot output will be the same, so long as the grouping is still by continent and plotted against GDP per capita. The use of `fct_reorder()` on the other hand does lead to an observable difference in the plot. Here, I called the function to reorder by the summary statistic maximum, so that the boxplot is arranged in order of increasing maxima. The ordering of the factors is the same as that observed using `levels()` above.

# Part 2: Files I/O

Let's output gap_RA tibble to a CSV file and then read it back in again.

```{r}
write_csv(gap_RA, "gap_RA.csv")

check_gap_RA <- read_csv("gap_RA.csv")

head(gap_RA)
head(check_gap_RA)
```

*Comments:* The head of gap_RA and the newly read-in CSV stored in check_gap_RA look to be the same. Success!

# Part 2: Visualization design

*Preamble:* Let's revisit a plot made using `ggplot` from a previous assignment and make it even better. I have chosen to use the following plot: Weighted mean of life expectancy (by population) across continents.

```{r}
#Set up parameters of the plot by finding the weighted mean by population, and then storing in a new tibble, A.
A <- gapminder %>% 
      filter(year == 1952 | year == 2002 | year == 1977) %>% 
      group_by(continent, country, year) %>% #Grouping by year in order to facet plot later
      mutate(wm = round(weighted.mean(lifeExp, pop, na.rm = FALSE), digits = 1)) %>% 
      transmute(lifeExp, pop, wm) #transmute removes all columns other than the ones specified

#Create a ggplot (this is the original)

P <- ggplot(A, aes(x = continent, y = wm, color = continent)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Figure 2: Weighted mean of life expectancy (by population) across continents", 
       x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy") +
  facet_grid(.~year)

P

#Create an improved ggplot

P_new <- ggplot(A, aes(x = continent, y = wm, color = continent)) +
  geom_jitter() + 
  labs(title = "Figure 2: Weighted mean of life expectancy (by population) across continents", 
       x = "Continent", y = "Life expectancy") + #Add title and axis labels
  facet_grid(.~year) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.5, size=8),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(colour = "white"),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14)
        ) + #modify text labels and other plot elements
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:20 * 5) + #set y-axis numbering
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") #set color scheme

P_new

#Convert this to a `plotly` plot:
 
ggplotly(P_new)

```

*Comments:* The improved `ggplot` is more visually impactful by stripping away unnecessary elements, resizing/relabelling, and providing more appealing color scheme.

The `plotly` plot is even more impactful in that it is a dynamic image that allows the viewer to effectively interact with the plotted data. The viewer can observe the values that underlie each point, zoom to a specific region of the plot, or remove geometric layers.

# Part 4: Writing figures to file

Now, we save the plots from above to file.

```{r}
ggsave("plot_raster.jpg", plot = P_new, width = 8, height = 4, dpi = 100) #save as a raster file format (.jpg)
ggsave("plot_vector.eps", plot = P_new) #save as a vector file format (.eps)

```

Here is the raster plot image embedded into the file:

# But I want to do more!

*Preamble:* Let's explore other functions in the forcats package for manipulating factors. I will use an excerpt of countries in the gapminder data frame and add language spoken. 

```{r}
#Create factor to join with gapminder excerpt
language_table <- tibble(country = 
                           factor(c("Italy",
                             "France",
                             "Spain",
                             "Mexico",
                             "Austria",
                             "Germany",
                             "Morocco",
                             "Angola",
                             "Brazil",
                             "Egypt")),
                         language = 
                           factor(c("Italian",
                             "French",
                             "Spanish",
                             "Spanish",
                             "German",
                             "German",
                             "French",
                             "Portuguese",
                             "Portuguese",
                             "Arabic"))
                           )

gap_small <- left_join(gapminder, language_table, by = "country") %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  transmute(country, continent, language) %>% 
  filter(language != "NA") %>% 
  droplevels()

#Show the use of collapse (Italian and Arabic into Other), recode (Spanish to Espanol), and relevel (French first)

gap_small_collapse <- gap_small %>% 
  mutate(language = fct_collapse(language,
                                     Other = 
                                       c("Italian",
                                         "Arabic"
                                         )
                                     )
         )

gap_small_recode <- gap_small %>% 
  mutate(language = fct_recode(language, "Espanol" = "Spanish"))

gap_small_relevel <- gap_small %>% 
  mutate(language = fct_relevel(language, "French"))

levels(gap_small_collapse$language)
levels(gap_small_recode$language)
levels(gap_small_relevel$language)

```

*Comments:* `fct_collapse()` can collapse multiple factor levels into a new one. Here I put "Italian" and "Arabic" into a new one called "Other". `fct_recode()` allows a factor level to be renamed. Here I changed "Spanish" to "Espanol". Finally, `fct_relevel()` changes the order manually. Here I put "French" first.
